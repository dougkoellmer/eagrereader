This is an experimental fixed-layout ePub3 reader. It's still in the prototype phases but is eventually meant to solve many of the problems with spatial awareness that students have while reading textbooks on typical page-by-page eReaders.

It leverages the open source CMS [https://github.com/dougkoellmer/swarm](swarm).
