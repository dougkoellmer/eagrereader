The book, extends grid, stored in NoSql (datastore)
==================================

- keyed by GUID

- has grid width, height, cell size, cell's taken, whatever from parent class

- release data

- version

- metadata, like publisher, authors, page count

- perhaps table of contents and spine (whatever that is) in the same blob?

- Things like author, ToC, etc. should be their own class, and members of the book class

- probably a query string with the book's 





The epub itself
===============

Think it's a good idea to store a raw reference to the epub, keyed by unique id, probably on cloud storage, in case i need to update the NoSql model with extra info





The content
===========

I guess cloud storage? The problem is that datastore has a max entity size of 1MB...probably fine for 99% of pages and images and other resources, but throw a large movie or model in there and we're fucked...it also doesn't seem a good conceptual match for the datastore, in the sense that these are just files
